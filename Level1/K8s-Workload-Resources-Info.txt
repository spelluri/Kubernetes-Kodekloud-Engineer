Kubernetes Workload Resources
Kubernetes has several workload resources, each designed for different use cases:
1. Pod

The most basic unit - a single instance of a running container
Usually not created directly by users

2. Deployment

For long-running applications (like web servers, APIs)
Keeps pods running continuously
Handles rolling updates and scaling
Example: Your nginx web application

3. ReplicaSet

Ensures a specific number of pod replicas are running
Usually managed by Deployments (you rarely create these directly)
Example: The httpd-replicaset you created earlier

4. StatefulSet

For stateful applications that need persistent identity
Each pod gets a unique, stable name
Example: Databases like MySQL, MongoDB, Kafka

5. DaemonSet

Runs one pod on every node in the cluster
Great for cluster-wide services
Example: Log collectors, monitoring agents, network plugins

6. Job

For one-time tasks that run to completion
Pod runs once and stops
Example: Data migration, batch processing

7. CronJob ⭐

For scheduled, recurring tasks
Creates Jobs on a schedule
Example: Backups, cleanup tasks, reports

Visualizing the Relationship
CronJob (manages) → Job (creates) → Pod (runs container)
                     ↓
                Runs on schedule
Deployment (manages) → ReplicaSet (creates) → Pods (run containers)
                        ↓
                  Always running
So Yes!
CronJob is a special type of workload resource specifically designed for time-based, recurring tasks. It's part of the batch/v1 API group, along with Jobs, because they're both about running tasks to completion rather than keeping services running continuously.
Think of it this way:

Need something always running? → Use Deployment
Need something run once? → Use Job
Need something run on a schedule? → Use CronJob
