A rolling update is like renovating a busy restaurant one table at a time while keeping it open for customers.
Imagine you need to update your restaurant's furniture. Instead of closing the whole place down, replacing everything at once, and then reopening, you do this:

You replace the furniture at table 1 while customers sit at tables 2, 3, and 4
Once table 1 is done, you move to table 2 while people can now use table 1 or sit at 3 and 4
You continue this pattern until all tables are updated

In the tech world, this same concept applies when updating software or apps:

You're running an app on multiple servers (let's say 10 of them)
Instead of shutting down all 10 servers, updating them, and bringing them back online (which would cause downtime for users), you update them one or a few at a time
Server 1 gets updated while servers 2-10 keep handling user requests
Once server 1 is back up with the new version, you move to server 2, and so on
Users never notice any interruption because there are always servers running to handle their requests

The key benefit: Zero or minimal downtime. Your service stays available to users throughout the entire update process, which is especially important for websites, apps, or services that need to be available 24/7.
