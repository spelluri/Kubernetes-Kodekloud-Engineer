What's Happening Behind the Scenes

During the rolling update:

Kubernetes creates new pods with the nginx:1.17 image
Once a new pod is ready, it terminates an old pod
This continues until all pods are running the new version
Your application stays available throughout (zero downtime!)

If Something Goes Wrong
If you need to rollback:
bashkubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
This will revert to the previous version of your deployment.
