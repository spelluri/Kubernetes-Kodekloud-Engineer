What Are Resource Limits?
Resource limits are like setting rules for how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container can use in your Kubernetes cluster.

🍕 Pizza Analogy
Imagine your Kubernetes cluster is a pizza with 8 slices:

Without Limits:
Person A: "I'm hungry!" *takes 6 slices*
Person B: "I'm hungry too!" *only 2 slices left*
Person C: "Me too!" *no slices left* 😢

With Limits:
Rule: Each person can take MAX 2 slices

Person A: *takes 2 slices* ✅
Person B: *takes 2 slices* ✅
Person C: *takes 2 slices* ✅
Everyone gets to eat! 🎉

Real Kubernetes Example

Your Server Has:
4 CPU cores
8 GB RAM

Without Limits:
App A: Uses 3 CPUs and 6 GB RAM (greedy!)
App B: Uses 1 CPU and 2 GB RAM (struggling)
App C: *crashes* - not enough resources left! 💥

With Limits:
App A: Limited to 1 CPU and 2 GB RAM ✅
App B: Limited to 1 CPU and 2 GB RAM ✅
App C: Limited to 1 CPU and 2 GB RAM ✅
All apps run smoothly!

Two Types of Resource Controls
1. Requests (Minimum Guarantee)

"I need at least this much to run"
Like reserving a seat on a bus

yamlresources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"  # I need at least 256 MB
    cpu: "250m"      # I need at least 0.25 CPU
Translation: "Give me at least 256 MB RAM and 0.25 CPU, or don't start me at all"

2. Limits (Maximum Allowed)

"I cannot use more than this much"
Like a speed limit on a highway

yamlresources:
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"  # I can't use more than 512 MB
    cpu: "500m"      # I can't use more than 0.5 CPU
Translation: "Even if I want more, stop me at 512 MB RAM and 0.5 CPU"

Complete Example  :

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx
      resources:
        requests:           # What I need minimum
          memory: "128Mi"   # Need at least 128 MB
          cpu: "100m"       # Need at least 0.1 CPU
        limits:             # What I can't exceed
          memory: "256Mi"   # Can't use more than 256 MB
          cpu: "200m"       # Can't use more than 0.2 CPU
```

## What Happens When Limits Are Exceeded?

### Memory Limit Exceeded:
```
App tries to use 300 MB (limit is 256 MB)
→ Kubernetes KILLS the pod 💀
→ Pod restarts (OOMKilled = Out Of Memory Killed)
```

### CPU Limit Exceeded:
```
App tries to use 0.5 CPU (limit is 0.2 CPU)
→ Kubernetes THROTTLES it (slows it down) 🐌
→ App runs slower but doesn't crash
