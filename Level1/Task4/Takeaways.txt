Key Takeaways

Requests = Minimum guarantee (what you need)
Limits = Maximum allowed (what you can't exceed)
Memory limit exceeded = Pod gets killed
CPU limit exceeded = Pod gets throttled (slowed down)
Always set limits in production = Prevents one app from ruining everything

Bottom line: Resource limits are like setting house rules so everyone can live together peacefully! 🏠



## Why Use Resource Limits?

### ✅ Benefits:

1. **Fair sharing** - Everyone gets resources
2. **Prevent crashes** - One bad app can't kill others
3. **Predictable costs** - Know how much resources you need
4. **Better scheduling** - Kubernetes knows where to place pods
5. **Stability** - Cluster stays healthy

### ❌ Without limits:

1. One app can consume everything
2. Other apps crash or slow down
3. Unpredictable behavior
4. Hard to plan capacity

## What Happens When Limits Are Exceeded?

### Memory Limit Exceeded:
```
App tries to use 300 MB (limit is 256 MB)
→ Kubernetes KILLS the pod 💀
→ Pod restarts (OOMKilled = Out Of Memory Killed)
```

### CPU Limit Exceeded:
```
App tries to use 0.5 CPU (limit is 0.2 CPU)
→ Kubernetes THROTTLES it (slows it down) 🐌
→ App runs slower but doesn't crash
