ImagePullBackOff means Kubernetes cannot download the container image from the registry. Let me help you troubleshoot!

Common Causes & Solutions
1. Typo in image name (Most common!)
2. Image tag doesn't exist.
3. Image is in a private registry (no credentials)
4. Network issues / Registry unreachable
5. Rate limiting (Docker Hub)
Docker Hub has rate limits for anonymous pulls:
6. Wrong image pull policy
