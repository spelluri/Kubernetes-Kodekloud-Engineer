What is a Namespace?
A namespace is just an empty logical container or virtual cluster within Kubernetes. It's like creating an empty folder - nothing is inside it until you put something there.
Think of it like this:
Namespace = Empty Box 📦

You need to manually put things inside:
- Pods
- Deployments
- Services
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- etc.

What Happens When You Create a Namespace?
kubectl create namespace dev

This only creates an empty namespace called dev. Nothing else.
You Must Explicitly Create Resources

What Namespace Actually Partitions

Namespaces separate almost all types of Kubernetes resources, including:
✅ Workloads

Pods
Deployments
StatefulSets
DaemonSets
Jobs
CronJobs
ReplicaSets

✅ Networking

Services
Ingress

✅ Configuration

ConfigMaps
Secrets

✅ Storage

PersistentVolumeClaims

✅ Access Control

ServiceAccounts
RoleBindings
Roles

Note : If you create a k8s resource without assigning t to a namespace it gets assigned to the default namespace . 
You cannot create a k8s workload resource first and then create a namespace later . It doesnt work like that .
You have to first create a namespace and then create workload resources and assign them to the desired namespace .
If incase you want to create a namespace at a later point of time then you have to delete the workloads and recreate those workloads to the newly created namespace .
